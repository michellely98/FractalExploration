# FractalExploration
First, we'll start by creating bifurcation plots of a few diagrams and mess around with the efficiency of using array calculuations and using numpy.

Then we'll recreate the SuPeR Fractal from Professor Ramsey's paper as well as the Logistic Fractal

#### Logistic Fractal

From here we'll experiment with different characteristics of the fractals, creating different images. These variations can be found in the Fractals folder.

#### 3D Fractal
Here is an animation of the Lyapunov Logistic Fractal in 3D. The code and more images can be found in the Markus-Lyapunov Fractal folder.
