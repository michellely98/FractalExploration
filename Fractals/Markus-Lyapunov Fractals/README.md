We have recreated the original Markus-Lyapunov fractal ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_fractal)) in python with matplotlib to explore its properties.

Stochastic AB Lyapunov fractal â€” in sequence "AB" there is a 50% chance at any time that the value will switch to the other (i.e., that A will switch to B and vice versa)

Probabilistic AB Lyapunov fractal - in "AB" the probability that the value will switch varies is listed above the graph
