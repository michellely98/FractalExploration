The SuPeR fractal, based on the Lyapunov-Markov fractal, was created by Shaun Ramsey, Dylan Paulson, and Nathaniel Schwartz in 2017. The original repository can be found here: [https://github.com/shaunramsey/SuPeRFractal](https://github.com/shaunramsey/SuPeRFractal).

We have recreated this fractal in Python in order to explore it further.
