The SuPeR fractal, based on the Lyapunov-Markov fractal, was created by Shaun Ramsey, Dylan Paulson, and Nathaniel Schwartz in 2017. The original repository can be found here: [https://github.com/shaunramsey/SuPeRFractal](https://github.com/shaunramsey/SuPeRFractal).

We have recreated this fractal in Python in order to explore it further. 

### Various SuPeR fractals

### Probabilistic SuPeR fractal - for sequence b1 repeated N number of times, b2 repeated N number of times -- the probability of the values switching is displayed at the top of the image
NOTE: Each frame of the animation has been averaged. In other words, multiple pictures, each with a different random sequence based on the probability, were computed and then averaged together in an attempt to improve the "shakiness" and randomness of the animation.

### 3D SuPer fractal -- for sequence b1, b2, b3 -- each frame of the animation is the b1-b2 fractal generated for that fixed value of b3 
This animation gives a glimpse into 3D space by taking slices of the 3D fractal at certain values.
